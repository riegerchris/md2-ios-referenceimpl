protocol MD2DataType: MD2Type {
    
    /**
        Unfortunately, a platformValue cannot be specified as attribute of the interface MD2DataType according to the reference architecture.
        
        Reason: Specifying a generic type, e.g. via typealias does not work in Swift yet because subsequent methods will not accept MD2DataType as input anymore (error: Protocol of type MD2DataType can only be used as generic constraint...).
        
        Using type Any? instead is the only viable option although of limited help as type casting needs to be done twice on every element like this: ((value as! MD2Integer).platformValue as! Int) which is cumbersome. In addition, it does not even enforce a specific type either but may instead cause runtime errors if the platformValue was set directly using the "wrong" type. A property oberser could check this but again relies on the actual implementation and cannot be specified here.
